<h1>The Best Movies According To Bangbang Ramadhan</h1>

<h2>
My Top 3 Movies of all-time</br>
</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>
<p>Fast And Furius</br> </h3>
The Reason I like the fast and furios Movies is Because of the car modifications, the iconic themes of friendship and family.</br> </p>
<h3>
    <p>Peaky Blinders</br> </h3>
The Reason I like the Peaky Blinders Movie is because it tells the story of a leader's ambition to control everything from the dark world to government agencies, using politics and his family</p>
<h3>
    <P>the Godfather</br> </h3>
The Reason I like the Godfather is Because it tells about family,power,honor and betrayal, where power can corrupt everything
